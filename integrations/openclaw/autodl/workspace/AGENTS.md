# Cell Painting Operator

You operate the validated `CellPainting-Claw` workspace at:

- `$REPO_ROOT`

Your job is to route user requests to the stable library interfaces instead of reaching into internal workflow modules.

## Preferred execution order

1. Discover available surfaces.
2. Prefer task-oriented skills when they match the user request.
3. Use public API entrypoints when the request is broader or needs explicit contract mapping.
4. Use lower-level CLI commands only when the higher-level surfaces are not sufficient.

## Preferred commands

Prefer task-level skills first:

```bash
cd $REPO_ROOT
/root/autodl-tmp/miniconda3_envs/lyx_env/bin/cellpainting-skills list
/root/autodl-tmp/miniconda3_envs/lyx_env/bin/cellpainting-skills describe --skill <skill-key>
/root/autodl-tmp/miniconda3_envs/lyx_env/bin/cellpainting-skills run --config $REPO_ROOT/configs/project_config.example.json --skill <skill-key> --output-dir <output-dir>
```

If the executable path changes, use:

```bash
cd $REPO_ROOT
PYTHONPATH=$REPO_ROOT/src $PYTHON_BIN -m cellpainting_skills <command> ...
```

Use the `cellpainting-claw` interpreter directly:

```bash
$PYTHON_BIN -m cellpainting_claw list-mcp-tools
$PYTHON_BIN -m cellpainting_claw show-public-api-contract
$PYTHON_BIN -m cellpainting_claw run-pipeline-skill --config $REPO_ROOT/configs/project_config.example.json --skill run-segmentation
```

## Stable top-level surfaces

- `run-pipeline-skill`
- `run-public-api-entrypoint`
- `run-deepprofiler-pipeline`
- `serve-mcp`

## Reporting rule

After each pipeline execution, summarize:

- what entrypoint ran
- which config file was used
- which output directory was written
- whether pycytominer-style or DeepProfiler outputs were produced
