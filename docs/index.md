# CellPainting-Claw

CellPainting-Claw was built to make Cell Painting work less fragmented and more usable through agents. Instead of asking users to stitch together data-access utilities, CellProfiler steps, pycytominer processing, DeepProfiler preparation, and agent glue by hand, the project exposes one documented skill catalog for both direct use and agent-mediated use.

The same documented skills can be used in two ways:

- **run the skills directly**
- **run the same skills through an agent**

## Project Layout

CellPainting-Claw is organized as a simple three-part structure:

![CellPainting-Claw structure](images/homepage_structure.svg)

People can use the same skills in two ways:

- directly, through `cellpainting_skills`
- through an agent, through `OpenClaw`

Both paths rely on the same foundation packages underneath. The lower-level `cellpainting_claw` package remains available for advanced direct toolkit use, but it is not the main starting point for most users.

## Core Packages

The foundation packages are easiest to understand in workflow order.

| Capability | Packages | Main capability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data access | `boto3`, `quilt3`, `cpgdata` | dataset discovery and download |
| Measurement extraction | `CellProfiler` | profiling tables, segmentation masks, labels, outlines, and crop-ready object data |
| Classical profile generation | `pycytominer` | aggregation, annotation, normalization, and feature selection |
| Deep feature extraction | `DeepProfiler` | learned single-cell feature extraction |

## Main Entry Paths

For most users, CellPainting-Claw should be understood through **two main usage paths**.

| Purpose | Start with | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| run documented tasks yourself from Python or from the command line | `cellpainting_skills` | you call the documented skills directly, such as segmentation, pycytominer processing, or DeepProfiler tasks |
| tell an agent in plain language what you want done | `OpenClaw` | the agent maps your request onto the same documented skills and runs them through the same toolkit |

## Public Skill Catalog

Skills are the **core public task interface** of the project.
